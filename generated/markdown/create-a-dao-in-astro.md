## Create a DAO (Astro)


## Introduction

## **Introduction**

A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that exists on the Blockchain. DAOs are the future of organizations because they allow anyone, from anywhere, to become a member just by joining the community and contributing to the success of the DAO.

DAO members can work on tasks at their own timing or pace, and can also be placed within committees. They can sponsor proposals or vote on proposals, allowing them to be a part of the decision-making process. This gives members a high degree of autonomy, which is one of the defining characteristics of a DAO.

There are certain components that are required to set up DAOs and they include:

* Governance
* Treasury
* Members

Governance is set up so that members can vote on proposals (be it on-chain or off-chain). It also shows what proposals have been agreed upon. A Treasury is needed to manage the funds of the DAO. From it, every type of payment activity which could be to individual contributors or projects is made while members are groups, committees, or councils that work towards a common goal in the DAO.

However, one major challenge that is faced when setting up DAOs is that there are different tools for various functions such as Treasury Management, Onchain Voting, Proposal creation, and so on. Also, many DAOs run on networks that have high gas fees and this can affect the operations of the DAO in the long run. 

This is why Astro is really important as it is a complete application for setting up and managing DAOs on the NEAR Blockchain. On Astro, you can create a DAO, set up custom function calls to perform specific functions, vote on proposals, manage treasury, verify participants, and much more. Built on NEAR, Astro also takes away the pain of high gas fees in the management of the DAO.

## Setting Up DAOCubator University

## **Setting Up DAOCubator University on Astro.**

Astro is a tool for setting up and managing DAOs on the NEAR Blockchain. On Astro, you can create a DAO, set up custom function calls to perform specific functions, vote on proposals, manage treasury, verify participants, and much more. Built on NEAR, Astro also takes away the pain of high gas fees in the management of the DAO.

In order to create a basic DAO on Astro, the following are needed:

* A NEAR wallet with a minimum of 5 NEAR (you should have more than that due to fees)
* The DAO name, purpose, link, and socials
* The DAO Type (Foundation, Club, Corporation, or Cooperative)

In this guide, we shall be signing up **DAOcubator University** (A DAO that teaches startups and communities learn how to build and scale as a DAO) on Astro. 

To get started, get a NEAR wallet [here](https://wallet.near.org/) and follow the process followed below:
1. Open [Astro DAO](https://app.astrodao.com/) and connect your NEAR wallet.
2. Click on “Create new DAO”
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/Create_New_DAO.jpg" alt="Create New DAO"/>
</div>

3. Input the DAO name (in this case, we’ll input DAOcubator University). The link to the DAO will read as daocubator-university.sputnik-dao.near. Once that is done, input the purpose [A brief description of the DAO]
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/DAO_Name_and_Purpose_new.jpg" alt="DAO Name and Purpose" />
</div>

4. Next is an optional field for KYC to note if the DAO (DAOcubator University) is a legal entity.
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/KYC.jpg" alt="DAO KYC" />
</div>

5. Provide the website and social links like Twitter, Discord, etc. (if available). It is also optional

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/Links_and_Socials.jpg" alt="DAO Links and Socials" />
</div>

6. Add groups to the DAO. An example is the Council (which is added by default). You could add new groups if you need to.
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/add_groups.jpg" alt="DAO Groups" />
</div>

7. Add members to the DAO as you sign-up or do this later
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/add_members.jpg" alt="DAO Members" />
</div>

8. Set how proposals will be created and the rights available in the DAO. You can choose between “Council” or “Public” or both.

Note: If you select Council alone, only those set as Council members will be able to create proposals in the DAO. However, if you also select “Public” then anyone with a NEAR wallet can create a proposal.
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/Proposal_Creation.jpg" alt="Proposal Creation" />
</div>

9. You can also set voting rights given to groups in the DAO.
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/Voting_Permissions.jpg" alt="Voting Permissions" />
</div>

10. Finally, create DAO assets by uploading the logo and banner of the DAO.
<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/dodao-daocubator-guides/main/images/guide_signup_on_astro/create_DAO_Assets.jpg" alt="Create DAO Assets" />
</div>

After completing all the steps highlighted above, Click on “Create New DAO” and then the work is done! Congratulations, we have created DAOcubator University as a DAO on Astro. Next is to explore the core features of Astro DAO.

## Core Features on Astro

## **Core Features on Astro**
<div align="center">

</div>

Navigating the new DAO on Astro is quite simple and there are some core features that you should know about.

* **Drafts**: These are unpublished content which could be proposals, bounties polls, etc. All drafts are shown on this tab

* **Proposals**: A proposal is an idea that community members may want the DAO to implement. They are written, reviewed, and submitted for voting based on the unique processes of the DAO. On this tab, you can check the proposals that have been created and their status.

* **Funds**: Here, Astro gives you a full view of the funds owned by the DAO. All funds received into the DAO show up on this tab. At this point, only the 5 NEAR deposited when signing up will be seen.

* **Members**: Every participant that joins the DAO is a member. The members are placed into groups based on their level of responsibilities in the DAO. These groups could be committees, councils, or working groups. On this tab, you can see the members of the DAO in their groups.

* **Settings**: Here, the DAO sets the rules that back the operations of the DAO.

* **NFTs**: Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique tokens on the Blockchain that cannot be traded like cryptocurrencies. They can, however, be sold or held. Simple examples of NFTs are cryptographic artworks where only one person can own the artwork at a time. You can view the NFTs owned by the DAO here.

* **Bounties**: Bounties are tasks where many members compete to win an amount by coming up with the best work. Here, you can see the bounties created by the DAO if there are any.

* **Polls**: Just like bounties, polls are created to get the opinions of the members of the DAO. Any poll created in the DAO can be seen on this tab.
