      "content": "## **DAO Governance - Proposals and Voting Processes**\n\nGovernance is one of the key elements of any organization. It provides leadership and direction to the strategy of the organization. Before DAOs, organizations operate a centralized system where people are employed to take decisions on behalf of the whole organization. This means that decisions taken by Executives determine how the organization grows and if it fails, they also take responsibility for it.\n\nHowever, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), operate a transparent system where rather than have a few people take all the decisions, the community work together by sharing and discussing ideas, developing proposals for ideas formed, and having them voted upon. If the proposal is valuable to the community, it is voted for and approved by the community for implementation and if it is not, then it is discarded.\n\nThis is one of the reasons DAOs are considered the future of organizations as they are inclusive, democratic, and transparent.\n\n## **Challenges with Fully Decentralized DAOs**\n\nA DAO by its basic definition is a decentralized entity. Anyone can be a member if interested in what the DAO is building and contribute their skills and time to the growth of the DAO. It also gives them the opportunity to come up with proposals that will develop further, the area of interest of the DAO.\n\nToday, DAOs have tens of thousands of members within their communities that are actively involved in shaping the future of the DAO. Now, imagine the time it will take if every member of the community comes up with a proposal and everything is to be decided by the community. The DAO may never be able to finish up as it will take a lot of time to go through all the proposals and vote on them.\n\nAlso, certain activities are strategic while some are trivial so creating proposals for every process or activity within the DAO would not yield many results considering the time put into developing it, hence the need for Councils.\n\nFinally, if the process becomes too tedious or lacks value, participation becomes quite low and this gradually defeats the concept of democratization in DAOs.\n\n## **Councils**\n\nThe Council Structure in DAOs is a system that selects or elects a specified group of people to serve as leaders of the community so as to manage high-level processes as well as monitor work progress. A number of DAOs are using this model since it makes work more sustainable (putting responsibilities on the members of the Council) and is widely accepted by Governments. \n\nBy having a Council structure, some of the proposals that would have taken the community a long time to approve due to conflict of ideas are done within record time. Also, strategy and execution within DAOs are aligned within a particular direction that the Council has taken. Different DAOs have various names for their Councils, however, the function remains the same.\n",

      "content": "## **Governance Policies**\n\nThis guide will give you an understanding of different Councils in various projects and how they are applied within their communities. The DAOs we’ll be looking at are three (3) DAOs that form the [Community DAO](https://gov.near.org/t/near-community-fund-vision-strategy-and-governance/4631) in the NEAR ecosystem namely:\n\n* Creatives DAO Council\n* Community Squad DAO Council\n* Marketing DAO Council\n\nWhile covering some policies from four (4) DAOs from other networks such as:\n\n* Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Stewards\n* Synthetix Spartan Council\n* Index Coop Council\n* Gitcoin Stewards\n\n### **Creatives DAO Council**\n\nCreatives DAO focuses on providing funding to creative works done within the NEAR ecosystem. They manage the process involved in screening proposals and ideas that will encourage more creative people to join the community as well as promote the works of others. \n\nSome areas that this DAO covers are music, art, virtual reality, events, promotions, etc. If the work is in some way related to a work of creativity and is to be built on the NEAR Blockchain, then this DAO is the place to go.\n\nCreatives DAO has a [Council](https://gov.near.org/t/closed-open-call-creatives-dao-council-5-positions-results-soon/11966) whose functions are highlighted below:\n\n* Create polls for all council members to vote\n* Carry out voting exercises within the allocated timeframe\n* Ensure that guidelines for submitting proposals are followed\n* Engage with off-chain proposals in the Forum when it’s necessary\n* Communicate with the community off-chain on request\n* Communicate with the Creatives Guild Leaders on Telegram as well as engage all introductory posts from prospective Guild Leaders.\n* Host and attend weekly Creative Leaders Meetup\n\nFurther duties of the Council can be found [here](https://gov.near.org/t/break-down-of-council-duties-for-each-council-members/26975).\n\n#### **Requirements**\n\n* The candidate must have submitted at least 2 successful proposals to the Creatives AstroDAO or to another Vertical's AstroDAO.\n* Worked as a Council member in another DAO\n* The candidate should be active on the Creative Guild Telegram Chat and Governance Forum (in the Creatives category).\n\nMore information on the Creatives DAO Council can be read [here](https://gov.near.org/t/creatives-dao-guidelines-community-draft/29851).\n\n### **Community Squad DAO Council**\n\nThe Community Squad DAO is the community that manages the governance processes within the NEAR ecosystem. They are involved with providing the voting process and requirements, funding community projects, determining what proposals should go through, etc.\n\nCommunity Squad DAO operates a Council structure where members manage the process of funding ideas and guilds activities with the NEAR ecosystem in a transparent manner. This involves reviewing proposals twice a week and voting on the project to know whether or not it should be funded by the NEAR community.\n\nIf the proposal exceeds 4 days, Council members get a message and if there are discrepancies, a discussion is held to resolve it. The Council is made up of 12 members who have contributed greatly to the NEAR ecosystem. More information bout them can be found [here](https://gov.near.org/t/community-squad-dao-council-an-introduction/4608).\n\n### **Marketing DAO Council**\n\nAlso, the marketing DAO is committed to ensuring that there is a system in place to ensure that the NEAR ecosystem continues to grow as it funds projects and ideas that will enable that in various parts of the world. From social media content to meme creation to events and meetups to growth hacking activities and more. The DAO continues to work with members of the community to reach new people.\n\nThe [Marketing DAO Council](https://gov.near.org/t/discussion-marketing-dao-council-members-remuneration/7808) is a group of people who oversee the functions of the Marketing DAO within the NEAR ecosystem. It is made up of 3 NEAR core team members and 2 community members. The functions of the council are highlighted below:\n\n* Increase awareness of what NEAR is and encourage people to come onboard\n* Work with the NEAR core team to approve funds requested for marketing-related activities\n* Receiving, assessing, and voting on proposals\n* Meet with project leaders to discuss their proposals, ask questions for clarity, and make amends where necessary.\n* Work with all approved projects and follow up on progress reports.\n* Submit reports on work done by the Council\n* Communicate with other Council members for at least 1 hour per week.\n\n#### **Requirements**\n\n* The Council is open to anyone applying, however, anyone interested in being a part of the Council must be deeply involved in the NEAR ecosystem in terms of contributing to the growth of the ecosystem. \n\n* The ideal person should have an understanding of the trends, players, risks, and opportunists in the ecosystem to be able to assess proposals.\n\nThe Marketing DAO is currently on pause as the Council works to come up with a more sustainable approach to operations in the DAO. Read more on this [here](https://gov.near.org/t/announcement-temporary-pause-and-review-to-marketing-dao/30223).\n",

      "content": "### **ENS Stewards**\n\nEthereum Name Service is the decentralized naming system for wallets, websites, etc. on the Ethereum Blockchain such that rather than have long wallet addresses, users can use any name of their choice with a domain extension of “.eth”.\n\n[Ethereum Name Service](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep12-social-working-group-rules/12953) (ENS) is operated by an open community led by stewards who manage working groups in the DAO. They are elected to lead working groups for two terms which last for a year. Every working group elects three stewards while having one lead Steward for the period.\n\nJust like Councils in DAOs in the NEAR ecosystem, stewards at ENS have the following functions\n\n* They are responsible for requesting funds from the DAO\n* They are responsible for overseeing the operations of working groups in accordance with the DAO's constitution.\n* Approve the creation of subgroups and workstreams as the case may be.\n* Disburse funds to the working group when necessary\n* Act as key stakeholders in working group multi-sig.\n\n#### **Requirements**\n\n* People who want to be a steward can nominate themselves or anyone else who they feel is qualified for the role. \n* They must also get at least 10,000 signed votes to stand on the ballot for election.\n\n### **Synthetix DAO Spartan Council**\n\nSynthetix is a DeFi protocol that provides synthetic assets on the blockchain based on real-world assets. The issuance of these assets is based on smart contracts developed by Synthetix known as “Synths” which are easily traded on Synthetix’s decentralized exchange.\n\nThis structure came as a result of the challenges faced with the transition of voting from Discord to Snapshot. The major challenge was that there was a major difference between both processes in that on Discord, one member had one vote while on Snapshot, holders of a large amount of SCCP tokens had more votes.\n\nSo, the [Spartan Council](https://blog.synthetix.io/spartan-council-proposal/) was set up to ensure that this challenge is solved. As a result, a group of people were selected as part of the Council and were tasked with the following responsibilities:\n\n* Approve proposed changes to the Synthetix protocol\n* Vote on proposals created in the DAO\n* Communicate with other council members on Discord and debate topics openly\n\n#### **Requirements**\n\n* The requirement for being a Spartan Council is to first be a member of the Synthetix community, then nominate yourself for the role and stand in for the election. Any member of the community who is then voted as part of the top seven in the election becomes a member of the Spartan Council.\n\n### **Index Coop Council**\n\nIndex Coop is a DeFi protocol that gives people the chance to own and hold indices of various cryptocurrencies rather than owning them separately to reduce the risk of loss for investors and traders.\n\n[Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/v2-index-council-contributor-vote-update/3958) operates a Council structure that allows the Council members to work for a six (6) month period and have the following functions:\n\n* Provide a high-level strategy for the community to work around.\n* Hire contributors for projects needed to be worked on.\n* Approve budget and funding required as and when due\n* Ensure the community (Nests) deliver based on the strategy of the DAO\n* Approve core team compensation changes\n* Determine contributors' rewards approach\n\n#### **Requirements**\n\nTo be a member of the Council, the person must be a Gold, Silver, or Bronze Owl (Level) in the Index Coop ecosystem and will nominate themselves via a Governance Forum post with the following information:\n\n* What they think Index Coop’s strategy should be\n* What is their stance on resource allocation, that is, the level of overall spending, any Nest, Pods, or initiatives which should receive more or less funding\n* What their stance is on delegation of decision-making, that is, what activity would they like to see the Council focus on, what activity would they like to see delegated\n* Why they think they would make a good Index Council nominee\n\n### **Gitcoin Stewards**\n\nGitcoin is the community of builders, creators, and protocols at the center of open web ecosystems. To achieve this, Gitcoin is creating a community and infrastructure for Web 3, that involves a diverse range of tools, technologies, and networks that enable people to work for the open internet.\n\nThis is done by funding projects, building community, and making learning resources accessible, we are teaming up to create the digital public infrastructure of tomorrow.\n\n[Gitcoin Stewards](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/introducing-stewards-governance/41) are members of the community with the responsibility of ensuring that the project is run smoothly. As a Grant giving organization, the Gitcoin core team thought about the process it takes the community to award grants as well as manage funding processes and how to make it more transparent. The core responsibilities of the stewards include:\n\n* Setting grants round categories and sizes (how much funding should go to a matching pool for core infrastructure as compared to community or media?)\n* Determining what kinds of public goods to work on\n* Defining what kind of behavior counts as a Sybil attack or collusion (when is collusion just squads vibing)\n* Finding credibly neutral ways to display grantees so that everyone has an equal shot at being funded",

      "content": "## **Recommendation**\n\nGovernance in DAOs still remains nascent and the choice to either operate as a direct democratized system or an indirect one through Councils is evolving for DAOs. However, the Council Structure looks like a great way to manage operations in a DAO in order to coordinate activities such as approving projects, funding, and other duties required to keep the DAO working.\n\nIt also makes the DAO to be more focused in terms of what needs to be done in that, rather than have every member of the community bringing up ideas, a set of people will be assigned to do that thereby reducing time to market for most work that needs to be done.\n\nThere are some ideas that could be explored when considering having representatives are highlighted below:\n\n* Councils do not have to be imposed on the community but should be voted by the community so they are trusted and the members who vote them in feel seen and heard.\n* Also, DAOs could have units within the DAO for various functions and then allow the members of those units to choose people who would become their representatives in the Council. This ensures a balanced representative system in the DAO.\n* Another area to consider is finding ways to reserve Council seats for a specific group. An example where this could work will be when there are some minority members of the DAO who would not be able to sponsor a representative. This approach allows for fairness and transparency which is the ethos of DAOs.\n\nIn making sure that the Council structure works well, one measure that can be taken having a fixed term for the Council to operate (maybe a six-month period) so that when that time comes, another set of people can be elected to serve in the Council. Also, the burden of performance should be on the Council members where there is a review of performance and if after a period of time, the community does not feel that the representative has worked well in their favour, then the person can be voted out and replaced by another person.\n\nIn the end, the Council structure is not perfect since there is a possibility of leaders taking bad decisions on behalf of the DAO. Synthetix is exploring [Version 3 Governance Module (V3GM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2fGO9FSvQk)) that allows for hierarchy in governance where token holders are above the Council and can collectively override the Council in the event of a decision that is not in alignment with the community.\n",
